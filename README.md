# leapy

This is my first game using PyGame, I created it for GitHub's Game Off competition on [itch.io](https://itch.io)

The theme was Leaps and Bounds.

## Controls

Press **SPACE** to **leap**.

Press **RETURN** to bend the rules of physics to your will and **bound** yourself to another gravity.

## Installation

You need Python 3.6+ and PyGame if you want to try it out.

### Linux-based
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yElSaadany/leapy.git
python leapy/main.py
```
Compiled version is coming soon.
