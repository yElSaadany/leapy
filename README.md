# leapy

This is my first game using PyGame, I created it for GitHub's Game Off competition on [itch.io](https://itch.io)

The theme was Leaps and Bounds.

## Controls

Press **SPACE** to **leap**.

Press **RETURN** to bend the rules of physics to your will and **bound** yourself to another gravity.

## Installation


### Linux-based

#### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yElSaadany/leapy.git
```

#### Play from the executable
```bash
cd leapy
./play
```

#### Play from the sources

You're gonna need Python 3.7+ and PyGame if you want to try it out from the sources.
```bash
cd leapy
python main.py
```
